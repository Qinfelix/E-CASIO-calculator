The code is for my first project in undergraduate period. The goal is to create a CASIO-inspired calcaulator which can be executed in Windows.

Though the final result is not as ideal and convinient as real CASIO calulator, the exe application can implement the nested-function-expression based on Object-oriented Programming (OOP) with a simple user interface(UI)
